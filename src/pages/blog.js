    <p>One of the most common problems an Internet user is facing with online payments is… variety. Indeed, choosing from countless options can be both a blessing… and a curse, especially if you don’t know what you are doing.</p>
    <div class="sideImg"><ImageFour /></div>
    <p>More often than not, an ewallet is the best online payment option out there, but what can you do when you suddenly realize the ewallet market is as congested as New York City during rush hour?<br></br><br></br>

 in a blink of an eye, yet what happens when those expectations aren’t actually met? Most importantly, how can you avoid these situations?<br></br><br></br>

You can very well start by reading this blog post and follow our tips on how to choose the best ewallet out there for your specific needs.</p>
<h2 class="main-h">Location, Location… Location</h2>
<p>First and foremost, it is very important to make an educated choice based on your country of residence.</p>

<p>You may find many ewallets, most with similar features, but you have to pay attention to the countries these ewallets target specifically. For example, online payment services like Yandex Money will be best suited for Russian-based Internet users. You can still register if you are a resident of another country, however, to get verified, you will need to send the documents attesting your ID and proof and residence to Russia via mail.</p>

<p class="contP">On the other hand, WebMoney may be a much better choice if you live in the US. WebMoney is a Russian-based company that has extended to well beyond its home country’s borders and is now a conglomerate of companies from all around the world, each making sure the funds are safe and guaranteed, no matter your region, US, Europe, or Russia.

Moreover, if you are used to using the handy prepaid vouchers and you are based in Australia, you can try myneosurf ewallet and never look back. Any Aussie can exchange the popular Neosurf vouchers to myneosurf money and use them for a variety of payments on & offline. Remember, myneosurf also offers a personalized Mastercard for you to use everywhere, even if you are on holiday, far away from the Down Under.</p>
