    <h2>What Is An eWallet?</h2>
    <p>An ewallet or a digital wallet is nothing more than a web application developed by a payment processing company that greatly facilitates the communication between a buyer and a seller.</p></article>
    <p>It’s an online account where you can manage your money just as you would with a normal wallet. You take some cash with you or you grab your credit/debit card, depending on the situation, you place it in your wallet, and start spending. The same applies to a digital wallet. After you’ve created your account following some simple steps - in most cases, just typing your name, e-mail address, and password - you can top-up your ewallet by adding funds via a variety of sources likebank transfer, credit/debit card, or even the trending prepaid vouchers like paysafecard or neosurf.</p>
    <div class="center-image" style={{ maxWidth: `600px`, marginBottom: `1.45rem` }}>
