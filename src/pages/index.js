    <p>The company behind Revolut is based in the UK. The payment method was released for public use in July 2015 and some four years later, the company claimed that six million people used it regularly. So far, there have been over 350 million transactions made using Revolut and more than £40 billion has been handled using the payment method.</p></section>

    <p>Revolut offers a range of convenient features. There are three plans to choose from: <strong>Standard, Premium and Metal</strong>.

Premium has more features available than Standard, while Metal offers the full range of Revolut services.</p>

    <h2 class="main-h" id="casinos">Revolut & Online Casinos</h2>
    <p>As of the time of writing, Revolut can be used to carry out a broad range of online transactions. It seems that the payment method isn’t currently available to use at online casinos for real-money gambling. However, there’s every chance that this will change in the near future and that Revolut will become available as an option for gambling online with real money. </p>
    <div class="center-image" alt="Online Casinos that accept Revolut Payment Method" style={{ maxWidth: `300px`, marginBottom: `1.45rem` }}>
    <ImageFour /> </div>
    <p>Online casino operators are keen to accept payment methods that are easy to use, convenient and reliable. Since Revolut ticks all of these boxes, it shouldn’t be too long before many keen online gamblers are able to select it as their preferred payment method. </p></section>

    <h2 class="main-h" id="crypto">Revolut & Cryptocurrencies</h2>
    <p>In recent years, cryptocurrencies have taken off and become very popular throughout the world. It all started with Bitcoin, which was officially launched for public use in 2009. Since then, a growing number of other cryptocurrencies have followed in its wake. Many people prefer using cryptocurrencies for online transactions because of the fast process times and the high levels of anonymity and security they offer.</p>
    <div class="center-image" alt="Exchange from fiat to cryptocurrencies" style={{ maxWidth: `300px`, marginBottom: `1.45rem` }}>
    <ImageFour /> </div>
    <p>Revolut is compatible with a number of the most widely used cryptocurrencies. With this payment method, you can exchange a total of 29 fiat currencies (standard, bank/government-controlled currencies) into the five following cryptocurrencies:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Bitcoin</li>
      <li>Litecoin</li>
      <li>Ethereum</li>
      <li>Bitcoin Cash</li>
      <li>XRP</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Getting fiat currencies exchanged into cryptocurrencies at crypto exchanges can take some time to do; it’s also not the most straightforward of processes a lot of the time. Revolut aims to make the whole process of converting fiat currencies into cryptocurrencies much more convenient and seamless. </p>

  <h3 class="main-h" id="faqs">FAQS</h3>
     <h4 class="main-h">How much does Revolut cost?</h4>
      <p>Revolut can be free to use - that is, if you go for the Standard package. The two other packages, Premium and Metal, are available for a monthly charge. Even with a Standard package, there are some extra fees. These include delivery fees for Revolut cards, £4.99 for Revolut cards after your first, £5 to have your card replaced, a withdrawal fee of 2% once you’ve passed your £200 monthly limit and certain currency conversion fees. For all full list of extra charges for all three packages, check with the Revolut Help Centre. </p>
      <h4 class="main-h">How do I use a Revolut card abroad?</h4>
      <p>If you’re intending to travel abroad, you’ll be pleased to know you can use your Revolut card while away. You’ll have to order it in plenty of time to make sure it arrives before you set off. Also, you’ll need to have verified your identity with Revolut. This is a simple process that takes no more than five minutes and requires you to supply Revolut with some photo ID and other relevant documents. </p>
      <h4 class="main-h">How do I order a Revolut card?</h4>
      <p>To qualify for a Revolut card, you’ll need to be a Premium or Metal member. You can join either one of these membership levels for a monthly fee. If you’ve opted for the free Standard option, you won’t be able to get a card until you sign up for one of the paid options. To order a card, you’ll need to have deposited some money into your Revolut account. To get a physical card, go to ‘Cards’ then ‘Physical’ and follow the simple steps to get one sent out to you. </p>
      <p>Note that it may take some time for your card to reach you. For a virtual card, simply go to ‘Cards’ and then ‘Virtual. Once ordered, your virtual card will be available to use straight away. You can only have five virtual cards at any one time. </p>
      <h4 class="main-h">What countries can I use Revolut in?</h4>
      <p>Revolut only supports those in the European Economic Area (EEA), as well as Switzerland, Singapore and Australia. More countries are expected to become compatible in due course. EEA countries include:</p>
      <p><em>Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</em></p>
      <h4 class="main-h">Does Revolut have a banking licence?</h4>
      <p>Revolut does indeed have a banking licence and it’s supplied by the Financial Conduct Authority under the Electronic Money Regulations 2011. There are several features of the app that are designed to maximise security and reduce the chances of things like phishing or fraud taking place. These include the Sherlock anti-fraud system (sends Revolut instant fraud alerts), one-time-use virtual cards for online payments, customisable features users can enact or switch off and the option to log into your account using your fingerprint. </p>
      <p>Revolut is soon looking to start using 3D Secure as well. With this, whenever you make certain online payments, so long as the merchant approves, you’ll receive a mobile message from Revolut prompting you to log into your account and verify the payment yourself. </p>
      <h4 class="main-h">How do I top up my Revolut card?</h4>
      <p>To top up your Revolut card, open up the app and simply head ‘Add Money’. If you haven’t already got a payment method linked to your account, you’ll be able to do that. Simply choose the type of payment method from the options given and fill in the required details. Once you’ve got one linked, select it and enter any details asked of you, along with the amount of money you wish to add to your Revolut account. If your chosen payment method has this exact amount of money, once you’ve confirmed the deposit, the money will be transferred over to your Revolut account ready to use pretty much straight away.</p>
     <h4 class="main-h">What is the age limit?</h4>
     <p>Revolut is only available to those who are aged 18 or above. There are, however, plans for a Revolut Youth app, which will enable those under 18 to use a limited number of services. They won’t be able to set up an account themselves, however. Instead, parents will be able to add younger ones to their own account as an extra user. </p>
     <h4 class="main-h">Can I cancel a Revolut card?</h4>
     <p>Of course. Should you with to have your card services stopped, simply get in touch with Revolut’s customer support team and they’ll get everything sorted for you. Give the team a call on +1 (844) 744-3512. </p>
     <h4 class="main-h">How can I get in touch with Revolut’s customer support?</h4>
     <p>The Revolut app has an in-app chat feature you can use around-the-clock to speak with a team member. Note that those who opt for one of the two paid packages have priority customer support. </p>
     <h4 class="main-h">Can I change packages once I’ve subscribed to one?</h4>
     <p>Yes, it’s possible for you to change packages. At any time you can move from the free Standard package to any two of the paid packages or vice versa; you can also switch from one paid package to the other. </p>
