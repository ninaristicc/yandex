    <p>WebMoney is such a service that can compete with the likes of PayPal or Skrill, at any time & in many places around the world. While it started as a Russian online payment solution in November 1998, during the last decade, the company has expanded its services to other markets like the EU or the US, 100% legitimately as you will read in our honest WebMoney review below.</p>
    <p>Yandex Money is part of the Yandex corporation - the biggest tech company and search engine in all Russia! The payment service was first brought forth to the audience in 2013 when Yandex joined forces with Russia’s largest bank Sberbank to create a brand new and competitive ewallet and business-to-business payment solution.</p></article>

    <article><p>According to global market researcher TNS, Yandex Money is the most popular ewallet in Russia with around 30 million accounts and some 15,000 registrations on a daily basis. The service is used for a variety of goods & products from gaming purposes - Steam, Nintendo, Xbox Store and many more - to Apple payments and yes, all sorts of online casino deposits and withdrawals. The possibilities are endless indeed, with Yandex Money.</p>
    <h2>What Is WebMoney?</h2> 
    <p>WebMoney indeed has over 20 years of experience online, going back to the Russian financial crisis in 1998 that devalued the Russian Ruble significantly. As the need for a safe haven like the US Dollar in Russia increased, so did WebMoney’s business..</p></article>

    <article><p>Soon enough, because of the company’s flawless reputation, users outside Russia demanded to have access to the payment solution, too. The merchants and yes, many online casino operators followed and included WebMoney as one of their default payment options. As a result, the Russian company had to change its business approach to fit the international needs.</p>  
    <p>WebMoney is now a conglomerate of companies with headquarters all around the world. In the US, for example, Amstar Holdings Limited represents WebMoney and guarantees the US Dollar assets commonly known as wmz. In Europe, WebMoney Europe Ltd. guarantees the EUR assets known as wme. In Russia, SANTIKA BUSINESS GROUP INC guarantees the Ruble title units known as wmr..</p>
    <p>All companies are regulated in their respected jurisdictions so you don’t have to worry about any legal complications that may appear with the unregulated ewallets.</p></article>

    <article><p>Don’t believe us? Just take your favorite casino for a spin using Russia’s most popular ewallet. We guarantee you will find very few places in the Internet gambling niche that don’t list Yandex Money as a viable and secure payment method for both depositing and cashing out. Stay tuned and be sure to bookmark this page for the very best online casinos that accept Yandex Money payment method!</p>
    <h2>How WebMoney Works</h2>
    <h3>Deposits</h3>
    <p>The process of depositing with Yandex Money is very straightforward, just like with any other major e-wallet. All you have to is choose Yandex Money, click on the Deposit button and enter your login credentials. One more click to confirm the payment and you will now be able to sit at any casino table you choose or play any slots with real money.</p></article>

    <article><p>Before you do that though, make sure you check what are the online operator’s requirements when using Yandex Money ewallet. Some will ask you to have a verified account which can be tricky for anyone living outside Russia. The most convenient way would be to send the required documents to the Yandex office in Moscow. However, for Russians or anyone visiting Russia, the verification process takes only a few minutes at the Unistream points/offices near your location.</p>
    <p>Also worth mentioning is the top-up options for your Yandex Money ewallet. If you are Russian, you can choose from dozens of ways to fund your account. Nevertheless, non-Russians have much fewer options. While the citizens of Lithuania, Latvia, and Turkey can still use the credit card top-up - VISA or MasterCard, the other EU and the US citizens can add funds either by making a bank transfer or receive payment via another verified Yandex Money user.</p>
    <h3>Cashing Out</h3>
    <p> If you have deposited with Yandex Money, then, most likely, you will be able to withdraw your winnings the same way, fast, just by clicking a couple of buttons. The process is even simpler than a deposit: click the Withdraw/Cash Out button, choose Yandex Money, and voila... the money should be yours for the taking in a matter of minutes or hours, depending on the casino operator.</p></article>
